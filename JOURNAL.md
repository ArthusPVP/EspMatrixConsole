## 10/9/2025 - created the schematic  

So, I started this project like 2 weeks ago and had the idea to document and make it found by hackclub. I've made a 16*16 red led matrix with 4 74HC595D to control 8 rows/columns each and to be able to use just 4 gpio pins to control the full matrix.
All of this project will be powered off of a 3.7v battery so I created a battery charger as well as a usb-c interface to deliver 5v. I also installed reset buttons and a 3.3v converter to power both the esp32 and the 74HC595D but not the led.
It was quite hard for me to chose a controller for the leds because there are soo many of them and it requires a lot of power (I wanted to do this with addressable led but they consumed way much power than I anticipated). ChatGPT helped me chose this led controller (and I don't really know it it will work).![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTI4MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--533b470cfd7c1dc1a7392de765d698a5fe9a038a/image.png)
